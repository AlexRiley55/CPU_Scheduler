## Introduction

This program is to simulate how a single CPU schedule threads through genetic algorithm. The program was implemented by C++.

The result will show mean waiting time in terminal and won't generate files after running.

You can use the input file (No I/O version) from CPU_Scheduler_NONML's test cases.
